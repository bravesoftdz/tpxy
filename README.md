Throttle Proxy
==============

Just a SOCKS4/5 proxy server to limit transfer speed.

Motivation
----------

I like Tox, but sometimes it takes all my bandwidth, so I thought it would be a 
good idea to limit the bandwidth for it. I was too lazy to do it the right way,
i.e. writing a network driver.

Compiling
---------

This is a very simple program, I just put some Indy Components on a form.

Open tpxygui.dproj in Delphi XE3 or higher and click the compile button.
